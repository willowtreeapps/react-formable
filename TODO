Make Fieldset and Fieldlist
Find a way to get ref changes to triger their respective events
Add optional prop to cause blur to fire event
Make Input, Radio, Checkbox, etc
Make lists of elements more readily mapped back to their origional element
Validate all named nodes, not just inputs. Keep an array of validators with a path they reference (if it isn't a node). At the end, select only that portion of the tree and pass it to that validator. Perhaps this same thing could be used with mapping values.

Ops stuff
    Get more examples in
    Get builds working for exporting the NPM package
    Properly type the form input
    Make sure types work on importing the package
    Document about refs / try to figure out a way to get ref strings working


THOUGHTS
- add onValidate(isValidating: boolean)
- add props for fieldValues, fieldErrors, etc. They will control the form if present. Done via setting the tree state maybe (or just in clone).

Publish
Use in a test app
Write release notes
